# GEOG5990M
Repository for an assignment of the GEOG5990M course of MSc GIS at University of Leeds

During the practicals of the GEOG5990M course an Agent Based Model was built. This model creates an environment and some agents in it.
The agents move and interact with their environment and with each other.

This repository contains:
1) final_model.py: the final code of the agent-based model
2) agentframework.py: the module including the Agent class
3) LICENSE: the license given to the code
4) index.html: the hand-crafted HTML code for the creation of the online portfolio asked for the assignment
